It is developed for the SwissFEL currently under construction at the Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland. The detector is a hybrid pixel detector with a charge integration readout ASIC characterized by single photon sensitivity and a low noise performance over a dynamic range of 104 12 keV photons.  Geometrically, a JUNGFRAU readout chip consists of 256×256 pixels of 75×75 μm2. The chips are bump bonded to 320 μm thick silicon sensors. Arrays of 2×4 chips are tiled to form modules of 4×8 cm2 area. Several multi-module systems with up to 16 Mpixels per system will be delivered to the two end stations at SwissFEL.  The JUNGFRAU full scale readout ASIC and module design are  presented along with characterization results of the first systems. Experiments from fluorescence X-ray, visible light illumination, and synchrotron irradiation are shown. The results include an electronic noise of  ∼50 electrons r.m.s., which enables single photon detection energies below 2 keV and a noise well below the Poisson statistical limit over the entire dynamic range. First imaging experiments are also shown.}

	abstract = {JUNGFRAU is a hybrid pixel photon detector developed at the   Paul Scherrer Institut for free electron laser (FEL) and synchrotron   applications. A charge integrating detector, JUNGFRAU features three   automatically switching gains per pixel which adjust the   amplification factor to the amount of deposited charge. This enables   single photon sensitivity, while ensuring a dynamic range over four   orders of magnitude. Each detector module consists of eight   256×256 pixel ASICs bump-bonded to a single   320 μm thick silicon sensor, resulting in half a   million pixels of 75 μm pitch arranged in   1024×512 arrays for a sensitive area of approximately   8×4 cm2. Modules can be combined in various   configurations to produce larger systems. These proceedings present   the required steps, both operational and in terms of data   processing, necessary to perform experiments with the JUNGFRAU   detector. This includes the calculation and application of pedestal   and gain corrections and the geometric arrangement of the recorded   image. Examples of these techniques in action will be presented from   the first experiments performed with JUNGFRAU detectors; the pilot   experiment of the SwissFEL Bernina beamline and proof-of-principle   macromolecular crystallography measurements from the X06SA beamline   of the Swiss Light Source. Successful operation and data processing   methods from FEL and synchrotron facilities will be compared and   contrasted, and experience of overcoming challenges in the two   scenarios will be shared. Finally, the capability of JUNGFRAU for   FEL and synchrotron applications will be demonstrated.}

	abstract = {The JUNGFRAU detector is a charge integrating hybrid silicon pixel detector developed at the Paul Scherrer Institut for photon science applications, in particular for the upcoming free electron laser SwissFEL. With a high dynamic range, analogue readout, low noise and three automatically switching gains, JUNGFRAU promises excellent performance not only at XFELs but also at synchrotrons in areas such as protein crystallography, ptychography, pump-probe and time resolved measurements. To achieve its full potential, the detector must be calibrated on a pixel-by-pixel basis.  This contribution presents the current status of the JUNGFRAU calibration project, in which a variety of input charge sources are used to parametrise the energy response of the detector across four orders of magnitude of dynamic range. Building on preliminary studies, the first full calibration procedure of a JUNGFRAU 0.5 Mpixel module is described. The calibration is validated using alternative sources of charge deposition, including laboratory experiments and measurements at ESRF and LCLS. The findings from these measurements are presented. Calibrated modules have already been used in proof-of-principle style protein crystallography experiments at the SLS. A first look at selected results is shown. Aspects such as the conversion of charge to number of photons, treatment of multi-size pixels and the origin of non-linear response are also discussed.}

abstract="We present an analysis on optimizing performance of a single C++11 source code using the Alpaka hardware abstraction library. For this we use the general matrix multiplication (GEMM) algorithm in order to show that compilers can optimize Alpaka code effectively when tuning key parameters of the algorithm. We do not intend to rival existing, highly optimized DGEMM versions, but merely choose this example to prove that Alpaka allows for platform-specific tuning with a single source code. In addition we analyze the optimization potential available with vendor-specific compilers when confronted with the heavily templated abstractions of Alpaka. We specifically test the code for bleeding edge architectures such as Nvidia's Tesla P100, Intel's Knights Landing (KNL) and Haswell architecture as well as IBM's Power8 system. On some of these we are able to reach almost 50{\%} of the peak floating point operation performance using the aforementioned means. When adding compiler-specific we are able to reach 5on a P100 and over 1on a KNL system.",

	abstract = {M{\"O}NCH is a 25 μm pitch hybrid silicon pixel detector with a charge integrating analog read-out front-end in each pixel.  The small pixel size brings new challenges in bump-bonding, power consumption and chip design. The M{\"O}NCH02 prototype ASIC, manufactured in UMC 110 nm technology with a field of view of 4×4 mm2 and 160×160 pixels, has been characterized in the single photon regime, i.e. with less than one photon acquired per frame on average on a 3×3 pixel cluster. The low noise and small pixel size allow spatial interpolation with high resolution.
 Understanding charge sharing as a function of the photon absorption depth and sensor bias is a key for optimal processing of single photon data for high resolution imaging. To characterize the charge collection of the detector, the sensor was illuminated with a 20 keV photon beam in edge-on configuration at the SYRMEP beamline of Elettra. By slicing the beam by means of a 5 μm slit and scanning through the 320 μm silicon sensor depth, the charge collection is characterized as a function of the photon absorption depth for different sensor bias voltages.}
