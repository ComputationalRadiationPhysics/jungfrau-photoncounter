Hi Michael,

Attached is a tar containing code, image files and binary pedestal and gain maps - everything you need except for the raw data which Martin arranges to transfer to you separately. I believe you already received some description of the procedure to calibrate raw data, so I will just describe what is attached.

The data we chose is from a diffraction experiment, so it contains some background, some diffuse scattering rings and some high intensity Bragg peaks. All three gain stages are accessed.

The .C and .h files contain helper functions and are called by the main script HZDRProject.cpp. This is the script that I used to make the images and the pedestal maps (the gain maps are created in another much more involved process). A makefile is included if you want to try to compile and run, but I guess this will require some adjustments.

in /data you have the binary pedestal and gain maps. There are three maps in each binary file, corresponding to gain 0, 1 and 2. The structure of the binary file is given toward the top of HZDRProject.cpp (struct GainMaps) and you find examples of how to read/write a map there too. Each map is an array of doubles, NCH (the number of channels) long.

In /plots you have images that should help you and the students understand the data.

In pedeG0, pedeG1 and pedeG2_hist_2d.png I show you the pedestals calculated from the pedestal file. Likewise, gainG0, gainG1 and gainG2_hist_2d_fromMap.png show you the calibration constants found in the gain maps.

The first analysis step is to separate the 16 bits per pixel into gain (2 bits) and adc (14 bits). adc_hist_2d and gain_hist_2d show you these raw results for the first frame of the data file.

By correcting for the pedestal you get the pedestal corrected adc, shown in image adcpc_hist_2d.

By calibrating using the gain maps you get the energy, shown in energy_hist_2d. In all cases I also zoomed in on a region of high intensity Bragg spots.

Feel free to get back to me with any questions / problems,

Cheers, Sophie

Subject: More details and sample data

Hi Michael,

Sophie is working on Jungfrau and will send you some test data and
format description you can play with.

The sample data file size is 13 GByte. Do you know a way to transfer the
data to you? Can we copy it to a place hzdr?

Cheers,
Martin
